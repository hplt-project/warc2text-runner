WARCsize,TB	83	93	94	365	204	91	420	449	358	768	641	total size of downloaded WARCs
#WARC folders	-	-	10137	39198	22323	9789	45305	49621	38782	83466	69386	CC provides a single list of URLs to download files from, aria2c was used to download all files to a single folder.
#WARC files	80000	88000	97948	378513	209680	94970	431363	457804	361431	754143	662381	number of warc.gz files
Approx. Time to download,days	2.5		4	39	6	4	42	19	40	26	28	This includes time to fix issues popping up and restart downloading.
Download speed,TB/day	33.2			12	16.4		15.6	34.6	17.6		22.8928571428571	WARCsize / Approx. time to download
download threads	20		1000	512		1000	512	256	128	256	2000	experiments with wide17 have shown that it is beneficial to use much more threads than there are actual cpu cores, downloading doesn't utilize CPU significantly

#files after warc2text	384360								1490152	1955584	2403058	Each task runs warc2text on 100 WARCs and creates a new folder for this task with one subfolder per detected language (about 120-160 in total) and 2 files (url.gz, text.gz) in each subfolder.
compressed text size,TB	8.4								19	42	18	total size after warc2text
size reduction after warc2text	9.88								18.84	18.29	35.61	WARCsize / compressed text size
#text.gz files	127853								495512	977792	798811	The number of fies with raw text
uncompressed text size, TB	18.04								38.15	130.82	43.65	raw text size after warc2text
uncompressed text size for 77 languages, TB	18								38.12	103.44	43.62	raw text size for 77 languages from the proposal after warc2text, for wide16 this large size reduction is due to filtering out examples classified as UNK (FastText langid for wide16, CLD2 for others)
warc2text time,h	23								38	500	48	Wall clock time of warc2texting, depends on the number of threads
warc2text threads	245								245	60	245	The number of threads used for warc2texting
