Not fired: Pres­i­dent Trump said he had a “good talk” with Deputy At­tor­ney Gen­eral Rod Rosen­stein this week and has no plans to re­move the em­bat­tled Jus­tice Depart­ment of­fi­cial. Rosen­stein was on the verge of re­sign­ing last month fol­low­ing re­ports that last year he dis­cussed se­cretly record­ing Trump and in­vok­ing the 25th Amend­ment to re­move the pres­i­dent from of­fice. He and Trump spoke for 30 min­utes aboard Air Force One en route to an event in Florida. “I didn’t know Rod be­fore,” Trump said af­ter­ward. “I’ve got­ten to know him, and I get along with him very well.” Rosen­stein has faced in­tense crit­i­cism from Trump and con­gres­sional Repub­li­cans over his over­sight of the probe into Rus­sian election in­ter­fer­ence. White House of­fi­cials say it re­mains likely that Rosen­stein will de­part af­ter the midterm elec­tions, es­pe­cially if the Repub­li­cans main­tain con­trol of the Se­nate and can con­firm Trump’s nom­i­nee.
