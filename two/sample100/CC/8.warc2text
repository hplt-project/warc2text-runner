It is evident you really&hellip;
Terri,
I wanted to thank you for the kindness shown to both Leigh and I throughout the evaluation process.&nbsp; Every three years as the reevaluation approaches, I get anxious.&nbsp; I am anxious, hopeful, but also dreading it in some respects&#8230;. hopeful&#8230;. thinking maybe this will be the evaluation that will provide a definitive learning disorder/diagnosis and a solution to help Leigh but then again dreading that this maybe another evaluation with no definitive&nbsp;answers and not much encouragement or solutions provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;
As you know, Leigh has had several evaluations over the years and none of the results have been conveyed with such compassion, care and concern and that matters.&nbsp; It is evident you really care about the children you evaluate and they are not just data you have collected on paper.&nbsp; I am thankful for all the information that you provided to&nbsp;me.&nbsp; You gave me more information and options than any evaluator has in the past.&nbsp; I am hopeful with your detailed report and all the options provided and with a lot of prayer we will move in the right direction.&nbsp;
