# NSDC partners SkillEd and Sony to integrate vocational education in schools through
PPP and CSR models 
by Team NSNSeptember 20, 2019in Government, News1
Vocational education under the Skill India Mission just got two new partners, National
Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), under the aegis of the Ministry of Skill Development
and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), signed two MoUs with SkillEd and Sony. The first partnership
is with SkillEd India towards using Kunskapsskolan Education Methodology (KED) in
schools and institutions through Public Private Partnerships (PPP) and using CSR
funds sourced from Indian businesses and corporates. SkillEd India is a joint venture
between Kunskapsskolan Education Sweden AB and Manav Rachna Educational Institutions
in India.

### NSDC signed two MoUs – one with SkillEd India to promote vocational education
using innovative Swedish KED methodology in schools and institutions; and a tri-partite
with Sony India and SkillEd to strengthen employment linkage.

### NSDC signed the second MoU with electronics major, Sony India and SkillEd for
a pilot project for imparting industry-specific skills and strengthening employment
linkages in the Retail sector. The training, by SkillEd India, will be provided by
highly qualified trainers in high-tech classrooms using KED and will provide placement
linkages to candidates receiving training from NSDC training partners under the fee-based
model or under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY). 

### International Conference on Corporate Social Responsibility

The two MoUs were signed at the International Conference on Corporate Social Responsibility
in New Delhi on 19th September 2019. Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Minister for Skill
Development & Entrepreneurship chaired a special session on ‘Perspectives on
Effectively Developing CSR Funds for Skill Development and Education’ at the conference,
where he stressed upon the importance of integrating vocational education in schools
and institutions and also emphasised on the critical role of public-private-partnerships
(PPP) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in supporting skill development programs
in order to make vocational training more effective and aspirational for the youth.

NSDC partners SkillEd and Sony to integrate vocational education in schools through
PPP and CSR models Urging corporates to contribute more towards skill development
through Corporate Social responsibility (CSR), Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Minister
of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship stated, “For boosting skilling and creating
an impact in the ‘Skill India’ mission, I encourage corporates to come forward
and contribute through their CSR funds to create a sustainable ecosystem. We are
already witnessing positive developments and it is encouraging that gaps are getting
filled with the increasing commitments of the private sector. We at the Ministry
of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship along with National Skill Development Corporation
are ensuring complete support to these organizations and look forward to partnering
with them to strengthening the skilling ecosystem within the country. With the vision
of making India the skill capital of the world, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra
Modi has also suggested effective CSR provision for the companies and I am confident
that under such resolve, we will be able to give impetus to entrepreneurship and
become the world’s largest provider of skilled workforce.”

Mr. Peje Emilsson, Founder and Executive Chairman – Kunskapsskolan Sweden AB, said,
“Skilled manpower plays a critical role in the overall development of the country.
With this tie-up Sony is playing a critical role in providing better employment opportunities
for the youth in India and enable them to succeed in life by tapping into their skills
and learning abilities.”

Talking about the collaborations, Dr. Manish Kumar, MD & CEO, National Skill
Development Corporation, said, “I believe that these partnerships with Sony India
and SkillEd India will provide sustainable livelihoods linkages to our youth, while
developing their skills and competencies. We hope that this tie-up will benefit both
candidates and the retail industry at large.

Sharing his perspective, Dr. Prashant Bhalla, President, Manav Rachna, said, “SkillEd
is channelizing trained candidates from NSDC’s ecosystem for Sony specific on-the-job
requirements and regular employments.”

The International Conference was graced by the presence of Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey,
Hon’ble Minister of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship; Mr. Peje Emilsson,
Founder Chairman Kunskapsskolan, Sweden; Dr. Manish Kumar, Managing Director &
Chief Executive Officer, NSDC; Dr. Prashant Bhalla, Chairman, ASSOCHAM & Chancellor,
Manav Rachna; Mr. Frederic Widell, MD, Oriflame India, among other industry and CSR
leaders.

NSDC, in November 2017, had initiated a pilot with Kunskapsskolan, a leading educational
Swedish company known for its KED programs – a concept for personalised education.
Under the project, over 200 teachers were trained in 100 schools in Haryana using
KED methodology. Furthering the pilot, the MoU has been today with SkillEd to roll
out the initiative across other states, with more sectors included and digitalizatising
the methodology in regional languages.

The partnership is aimed at three verticals — to support skill development in schools
using KED methodology that will focus on providing employable skills to school drop-outs;
varied skill development projects; and provide adequate training to teachers and
setting up of a Global Institute of Skills, focusing on global employability of Indian
workforce. The duration of this training will be up to 35 days and trainees will
be paid a stipend conforming to minimum wages set by the Government and will range
from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 17,000 per month.

The International Conference aimed at providing a common platform to the corporates,
government agencies, NGOs, academics and the other groups to share their expectations,
aspirations and responsibilities towards CSR. NSDC, through its Industry Partnership
and CSR division has been leading CSR initiatives and corporate partnerships to strengthen
the Skill India Mission by inviting contributions from corporates through funding,
infrastructure, training of trainers and candidates. In the last 3 years, NSDC has
collaborated with over 70 industry partners such as Daikin, Hero Motocorp, Jaquar
Foundation, DFHL, SBI Cards, Ingersoll Rand, Schneider, Balrampur Chini Mills, among
others to catalyse quality vocational training in India across different sectors.
