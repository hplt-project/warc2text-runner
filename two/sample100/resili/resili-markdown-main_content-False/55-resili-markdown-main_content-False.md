Grooming is for everybody and men can’t be too lenient with their skincare. Women
are inherently proactive about their grooming and skincare needs, but men need that
extra push. If you are that guy who is still using a soap bar, you need to stop buddy!

Not that there is a lack of evidence of how harsh can be the cleaning ingredients
in the soap for the supple face skin, but men are deceived by their false sense of
machoism. We strongly advise you to switch to face wash for a healthy and fresh glow
on your face.

GreatBuyz reviewed over 30 best face washes for men to pick the top 10. Don’t worry
you can trust our judgment as we looked for products for every skin type before listing
them here.

Here are the top 10 scrutinized and tested best face washes for men in India.

# FAQ

Q. How to choose the right face wash?

Maybe we made it easy for you to pick the best face wash for men, still, you must
be aware of the factors to check before selecting a product.

Q How to select the right facewash for Oily skin?

The oily skin is the trickiest to manage. Due to excess sebum production, the moisture
is held in the skin which makes it dull and clogs pores causing acne. Dermatologists
suggest face washes with salicylic acid or lactic acid for oily skin.

Q. How to select the right facewash for Dry skin?

If you have dry skin, then you must avoid face washes with alcohols, sodium lauryl
sulfate, triclosan, salicylic acid, and glycolic acid. Pick milk or gel-based face
washes that preserve natural skin oils.

Q. How to select the right facewash for Sensitive/Combination skin?

Sensitive and combination skin is easily irritated and requires chemical-free face
washes with ingredients like aloe, chamomile, and green tea polyphenols. Such soothing
ingredients keep the skin healthy.

Q. How to select the right facewash for Normal skin?

Normal skin is easiest to manage so you can try a face wash that is suitable for
all skin types.

Q. How often should men wash their face?

Generally speaking, washing your face twice a day, once in the morning and once
at night, is enough for most men. You will risk drying your skin if you do it any
more often. Although a splash of water in the afternoon is alright for men with oily
skin.
