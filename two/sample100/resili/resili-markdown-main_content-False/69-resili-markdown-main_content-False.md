# Omada Identity Manager 6.1
by Martin KuppingerPosted on May 07, 2008
Over the past 2 years the Danish software company Omada has reached the position
as Microsoft's most important technology partner in the field of MIIS and ILM. In
cooperation with Microsoft the vendor was able to win several major clients.

Omada has been extending the Microsoft technology that currently and primarily is
focused on the technical synchronisation of identity information by further reaching
functions for role-based access control and workflows, self-service interfaces and
increasingly also by extended GRC functions for compliance monitoring, attestation
and other tasks.
