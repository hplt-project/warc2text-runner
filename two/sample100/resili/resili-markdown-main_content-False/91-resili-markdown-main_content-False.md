## Treatments for Knee Conditions

Specialists at GW Hospital provide advanced treatments for complex knee conditions
such as osteoarthritis, tendonitis, bursitis, ligament injuries (torn ACL), and knee
effusion. These conditions can lead to pain, swelling, and limited use of the knee.

###  ROSA® Robotic Knee Replacement System

GW Hospital is the first in Washington, D.C. to use the ROSA® (Robotic Surgical
Assistant) Knee System for total joint replacements. The ROSA system assists surgeons
and enables them to perform procedures with greater accuracy, tailoring the fitting
of the implant to your unique anatomy. The surgeon uses data collected before and
during the procedure to improve the precision of the fitting. This helps improve
comfort and your overall experience after the surgery.

This is a minimally invasive surgery that can result in less scarring, a quicker
recovery and less pain.

under direct guidelines for safely returning you to your sport and usual activities.

####  Joint Replacement Rehabilitation Program

The joint program focuses on optimizing patient readiness for and recovery from
joint replacement surgery. Patients will be seen prior to surgery to review how best
to prepare for surgery and what to expect when they get home from the hospital. Patients
will be on a formalized surgeon-therapist collaborative protocol for postoperative
rehabilitation. The primary goal is to restore independent function and optimize
mobility as quickly as possible.

###  Blue Distinction® Center for Knee Replacement

Blue Distinction CenterIn 2020, GW Hospital received designation as a Blue Distinction®
Center for Knee and Hip Replacement from CareFirst BlueCross® BlueShield® (CareFirst),
as part of the Blue Distinction Specialty Care program. This remarkable achievement
demonstrates our ongoing commitment to providing the highest quality, patient centric
care in orthopedic surgery.

###  Knee Conditions

####  Osteoarthritis

Osteoarthritis, also called degenerative joint disease, occurs when the cartilage
in your joints wears down, causing your bones to rub together. It is the most common
form of arthritis and can cause pain, swelling and reduced motion in your joints.

####  Knee Effusion

A knee effusion, or water on the knee, occurs when excess fluid builds up around
the knee joint, causing swelling, pain and stiffness. This can be caused by arthritis
or injury.

####  Meniscal Tear

The meniscus is the cartilage that cushions the knee. A meniscal tear can occur
when you twist or over-flex your knee, or quickly stop and change direction.

####  Ligament Strain or Tear

Direct contact to the knee or changing direction rapidly while running can cause
a knee ligament to stretch or tear. This can affect any of the four ligaments in
the knee, which are the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL and PCL) and
the medial and lateral collateral ligaments (MCL and LCL).

####  Patellar Subluxation

A kneecap dislocation or sublaxation can occur when the knee is hit from the side
or when it is suddenly twisted or turned. Swelling and pain are the result.

####  Bursitis

Bursitis occurs when a bursa, a small sac filled with lubricating fluid that serves
as a cushion between a bone and other moving parts, becomes inflamed. Pain, swelling,
and stiffness are likely to occur.

####  Baker’s Cyst

A Baker's cyst occurs when joint fluid builds up and leads to the formation of a
cyst behind the knee. This is normally caused by meniscal tears, cartilage injuries,
or arthitis.

####  Rheumatoid Arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks the tissues
that line your joints, causing pain, swelling, stiffness and loss of function in
your joints. Over time it can cause damage to bone and cartilage in the joints.

\*Individual results may vary. There are risks associated with any surgical procedure.
Talk with your doctor about these risks to find out if minimally invasive surgery
is right for you.​
