#  Writing as a Business

Very good overview article on thinking about your writing career. When the time is
right, my clients and I discuss the business aspects of writing. This ranges from
our first contact when they’re wondering whether their work is marketable to considering
their audience’s needs during editing or rewriting. When the final product is done,
we then discuss market trends that will impact their choice of agents and publishers.

Publishing is a business and, as the author, you must consider yourself the CEO of
your book. From start to finish—the germ of a book idea to publication (and beyond)—you
must take charge. If you make good business decisions, you will surely experience
greater success. If not, then, you could be one of the nearly 78 percent of authors
who fail.

Your query letter is every bit as important as the opening pages of your novel.
It’s your first opportunity to show your writing skills to a prospective agent
or editor. Make it count! Make it shine! A good query letter should make that editor
and agent want to read your material…and it should grab their hearts in the thirty
seconds or so they give each query in their pile. In this class, publishing consultant
and owner of the Writer’s Resource Laine Cunningham will discuss the three important
elements to inject into your query so you can get published. Fiction and nonfiction
authors writing books, stories or articles will benefit from this class.

Laine Cunningham’s clients consistently garner attention from the nation’s top
publishers and agents. Several of her clients’ books have been shopped around Hollywood
and have received film options. She has been quoted on CNN MoneyMedia Bistro, and The
Writer Magazine for her opinion on the end of the Harry Potter series, the “Oprah
Effect,” and Sarah Palin’s ghostwriter. She has presented workshops and lectures
for The Loft, the nation’s largest independent literary organization; the National
Writer’s Union; The Writer’s Workshop in Asheville and writing conferences across
the country.
