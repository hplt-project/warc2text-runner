Comments about A4 Athletic Apparel A4 Moisture Management Coaches Polo:

I was impressed with the material and stitching of the garment, and I like the longer
shirttails. However, I found this shirt to be tight in the shoulders and across the
chest compared to several other similarly styled shirts I have from other manufacturers
in the same size. Definitely a good value and quality for the price, but I would
recommend going one size larger if you order this product.

- Sizing:
- Feels too small

Comments about A4 Athletic Apparel A4 Moisture Management Coaches Polo:  

Yes, I would recommend this to friends and I have done so. You cannot beat the price
of this shirt for the type of material you are receiving. I wear it at least once
per week. I only wish Baseball Express would get more product in the polo style from
the same manufacturer.  

- Sizing:
- Feels true to size
