### International Conference on Corporate Social Responsibility

The two MoUs were signed at the International Conference on Corporate Social Responsibility
in New Delhi on 19th September 2019. **Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Minister for Skill
Development & Entrepreneurship** chaired a special session on *‘Perspectives
on Effectively Developing CSR Funds for Skill Development and Education’* at the
conference, where he stressed upon the importance of integrating vocational education
in schools and institutions and also emphasised on the critical role of public-private-partnerships
(PPP) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in supporting skill development programs
in order to make vocational training more effective and aspirational for the youth.

Urging corporates to contribute more towards skill development through Corporate
Social responsibility (CSR), **Dr. Mahendra Nath Pandey, Minister of Skill Development
and Entrepreneurship** stated, “For boosting skilling and creating an impact in
the ‘Skill India’ mission, I encourage corporates to come forward and contribute
through their CSR funds to create a sustainable ecosystem. We are already witnessing
positive developments and it is encouraging that gaps are getting filled with the
increasing commitments of the private sector. We at the Ministry of Skill Development
and Entrepreneurship along with National Skill Development Corporation are ensuring
complete support to these organizations and look forward to partnering with them
to strengthening the skilling ecosystem within the country. With the vision of making
India the skill capital of the world, Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi
has also suggested effective CSR provision for the companies and I am confident that
under such resolve, we will be able to give impetus to entrepreneurship and become
the world’s largest provider of skilled workforce.”

**Mr. Peje Emilsson, Founder and Executive Chairman – Kunskapsskolan Sweden AB**,
said, “Skilled manpower plays a critical role in the overall development of the
country. With this tie-up Sony is playing a critical role in providing better employment
opportunities for the youth in India and enable them to succeed in life by tapping
into their skills and learning abilities.”

Talking about the collaborations, **Dr. Manish Kumar, MD & CEO, National Skill
Development Corporation**, said, “I believe that these partnerships with Sony India
and SkillEd India will provide sustainable livelihoods linkages to our youth, while
developing their skills and competencies. We hope that this tie-up will benefit both
candidates and the retail industry at large.

Sharing his perspective, **Dr. Prashant Bhalla, President, Manav Rachna,** said,
“SkillEd is channelizing trained candidates from NSDC’s ecosystem for Sony specific
on-the-job requirements and regular employments.”

NSDC, in November 2017, had initiated a pilot with Kunskapsskolan, a leading educational
Swedish company known for its KED programs – a concept for personalised education.
Under the project, over 200 teachers were trained in 100 schools in Haryana using
KED methodology. Furthering the pilot, the MoU has been today with SkillEd to roll
out the initiative across other states, with more sectors included and digitalizatising
the methodology in regional languages.

The partnership is aimed at three verticals — to support skill development in schools
using KED methodology that will focus on providing employable skills to school drop-outs;
varied skill development projects; and provide adequate training to teachers and
setting up of a Global Institute of Skills, focusing on global employability of Indian
workforce. The duration of this training will be up to 35 days and trainees will
be paid a stipend conforming to minimum wages set by the Government and will range
from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 17,000 per month.

The International Conference aimed at providing a common platform to the corporates,
government agencies, NGOs, academics and the other groups to share their expectations,
aspirations and responsibilities towards CSR. NSDC, through its ** Industry Partnership
and CSR** division has been leading CSR initiatives and corporate partnerships to
strengthen the Skill India Mission by inviting contributions from corporates through
funding, infrastructure, training of trainers and candidates. In the last 3 years,
NSDC has collaborated with over 70 industry partners such as Daikin, Hero Motocorp,
Jaquar Foundation, DFHL, SBI Cards, Ingersoll Rand, Schneider, Balrampur Chini Mills,
among others to catalyse quality vocational training in India across different sectors.
