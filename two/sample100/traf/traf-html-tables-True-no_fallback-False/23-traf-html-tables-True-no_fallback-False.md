Your query letter** **is every bit as important as the opening pages of your novel.
It’s your first opportunity to show your writing skills to a prospective agent
or editor. Make it count! Make it shine! A good query letter should make that editor
and agent want to read your material…and it should grab their hearts in the thirty
seconds or so they give each query in their pile. In this class, publishing consultant
and owner of the Writer’s Resource Laine Cunningham will discuss the three important
elements to inject into your query so you can get published. Fiction and nonfiction
authors writing books, stories or articles will benefit from this class.
