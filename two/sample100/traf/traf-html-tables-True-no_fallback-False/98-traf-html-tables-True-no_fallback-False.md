**Why my BenQ M775C is locked?**
&#13;
When you purchase a cell phone it is often offered at a discounted price by the cellular
network. In return for this generosity they "lock" your BenQ M775C to their network,
so that you can only use their network for making and receiving calls. This means
that you cannot use the SIM card of another network, and if you try to do so the
phone will display "Phone Restricted", “Contact Service Provider”, “Enter Unlock
Code” or a similar message. Unlocking the phone removes this lock, allowing you
to use your BenQ M775C on any GSM wireless network anywhere in the world.

&#13;                                No, even if you upgrade the software (flash)

**What is a SIM Card?**  
&#13;						A SIM card or Subscriber Identity Module is a portable memory chip used
in GSM phones. The SIM Card allows users to change phones by simply removing the
SIM Card from one cell phone and inserting it into another. The SIM holds personal
identity information, cell phone number, phone book, text messages and other data.****

**How does the remote unlocking work?**  
&#13;                                Upon successful order submission, we will process
your BenQ M775C's unique IMEI number and email back an unlock code.
&#13;				&#13;
**What does IMEI mean?**  
&#13;                                The International Mobile Equipment Identity
or IMEI is a 15 digit serial number unique to every GSM cell phone. We generate the
unlocking code from the IMEI, this is called remote unlocking.
&#13;				&#13;
**How to get the IMEI#?**  
&#13;                                Enter \*#06# into your phone to retrieve the
unique 15 digit IMEI number. It can also be found printed on the back of the phone
underneath the battery.
&#13;				&#13;
**Is cable and software required?**  
&#13;                                No software or cable is required at all.
&#13;				&#13;

**Is cell phone unlocking legal?  
**Yes is legal. On November 26, 2006, the U.S. Copyright Office ruled that consumers
can legally unlock their cell phones in order to use them with rival carriers. Some
times you might be able to ask your network to provide you with an unlock code. However,
they will only do this for free if you have completed your contract. Obviously most
networks don't want you moving away from their network so they will often charge
extortionate rates to unlock your BenQ M775C and you can also be made to wait up
to 3 weeks to receive your unlock codes.
