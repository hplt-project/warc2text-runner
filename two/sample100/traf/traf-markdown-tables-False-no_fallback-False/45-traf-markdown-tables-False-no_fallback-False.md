**International Students in Germany: **Moving towards "prior education" as a criterion for international mobility.
**International students are classified into two categories:**
• Bildungsauslaender: Foreign country of previous education/study (level of secondary education completed in countries outside Germany)
• Bildungsinlaender: Previous education/study in Germany (level of secondary education completed in Germany)
**Private Higher Education Institution:** Private HEI have private founding bodies. Numbers for German and foreign students are only collected by the federal statistical office if a private HEI has been awarded state recognition.
