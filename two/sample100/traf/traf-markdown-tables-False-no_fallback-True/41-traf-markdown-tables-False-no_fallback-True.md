Not fired: President Trump said he had a “good talk” with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein this week and has no plans to remove the embattled Justice Department official. Rosenstein was on the verge of resigning last month following reports that last year he discussed secretly recording Trump and invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. He and Trump spoke for 30 minutes aboard Air Force One en route to an event in Florida. “I didn’t know Rod before,” Trump said afterward. “I’ve gotten to know him, and I get along with him very well.” Rosenstein has faced intense criticism from Trump and congressional Republicans over his oversight of the probe into Russian election interference. White House officials say it remains likely that Rosenstein will depart after the midterm elections, especially if the Republicans maintain control of the Senate and can confirm Trump’s nominee.
