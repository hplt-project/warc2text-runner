# Blog: Volvo Trucks and Van Damme's 'Epic Split'

Dave Leggett | 7 February 2014

Look, I don't seek out things like this. I was on Volvo Group's website looking for serious stuff about trucks and then I stumbled on a release about an 'Epic Split' featuring the actor sometimes known as 'muscles from Brussels'. Eh? I had to have a look. Have a look yourself (you may already have seen; it's had 69m views but passed me by). Great concentration from Mr Van Damme and the truck drivers. Nicely shot, too. (A colleague has also pointed out that there was a reply from Chuck Norris.)
