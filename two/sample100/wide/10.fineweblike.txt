I joined the Department in 1998 from Lancaster University where I had been Deputy Director of the Centre for Science Studies and Science Policy. I have a BA in Experimental Psychology from University of Oxford and PhD in Social Psychology from University of Durham. Despite this background in psychology I have managed to transform myself into a sociologist of sorts, even going so far as to serve as Head of the Sociology Department 2001-2004.
My teaching reflects my interests in microsociology, qualitative methods and recent theoretical perspectives on materiality. I have offered options in Science and Society, Animals and Society, and Sociologies of Everyday Life.
Sociology of science and technology; public understanding of science; sociology of the environment; sociology of everyday life; animals and society; social theory and materiality; sociology and design; biomedicine, biotechnology and culture.
I have successfully supervised over 25 PhD theses. The most recent include:
