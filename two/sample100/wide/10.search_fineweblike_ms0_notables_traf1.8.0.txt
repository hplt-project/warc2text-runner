I joined the Department in 1998 from Lancaster University where I had been Deputy Director of the Centre for Science Studies and Science Policy. I have a BA in Experimental Psychology from University of Oxford and PhD in Social Psychology from University of Durham. Despite this background in psychology I have managed to transform myself into a sociologist of sorts, even going so far as to serve as Head of the Sociology Department 2001-2004.

My teaching reflects my interests in microsociology, qualitative methods and recent theoretical perspectives on materiality. I have offered options in Science and Society, Animals and Society, and Sociologies of Everyday Life.
