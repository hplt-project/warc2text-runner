CFW Cheat PKG and EBOOT request thread.
Post you requests for cheat eboots and PKGs here, may take time to get back to you as I'm busy with work.
Game ID and Update version required in all requests.
If anyone wants to have a go at editing their own EBOOTs for swapping with their game EBOOT or making into an update PKG, I've put together a pack with what you need and a guide here:

Don't think anyone has had much luck finding offsets for that game yet... Maybe in a few months.
