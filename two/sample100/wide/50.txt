I can see this especially in the branching hammer & frogspawn as they dont close as much at night as with the reef crest mode...
awesum thanks... so i will try reef crest aswell wen i set mine up, can u programe it to switch over to night? or must you do it manually every evening?

Did you move your hammer higher in your tank?
How is your hammer coral doing lately?
Is it still receding?

It has a setting for automatic night mode. You have to wait till the exact time you want it to start night mode, then press mode+set button together untill light changes color (red-green-yellow flashing). Press mode+set button again untill it enters night mode (light will pulse white).
& thats it, your unit enters night mode exactly the same time every day & stays in night mode for 8 hours (if i remember correctly).

This all happened 2 years ago already just after I got the coral. It has been fine ever since and has grown quite a bit. They dont regrow into the dead skeleton though. Its in a medium light area with very gentle flow.

At first, the mp10 might not impress you that much since it is only a flow pump, but after you ran it a few days, you will see the difference in your tank & happiness of your corals & you will change your mind....

Have you got a tank thread? If not, please make one, even if you haven't started the tank officially, lol.
Makes it easier to help you out if you have any questions when we know the history of the tank... (that; and were all a very curious bunch,
)

You guys were right about helping a hammer coral to recover, i tried the iodine dips & lightly blasting with turkey baster, but its damage has gone too far...
Thanks for the advice you guys,
